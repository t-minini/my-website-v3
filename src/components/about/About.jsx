        With a diverse background in construction, interior design,
        architecture, and hospitality, I offer a unique perspective to my work.
        Originally from Brazil, now based in Dublin, I discovered my passion for
        front-end development in 2022, when I completed Ironhack's full-stack
        web development bootcamp, which equipped me with the skills to create
        visually appealing and user-friendly websites. As a dedicated
        professional, I'm committed to continuous learning to hone my
        professional skills and contribute to innovative projects.
